Module integrated in the EPILAB toolbox.

1. Modifications were done to the already existing functions:

  * Artificial_Neural_Networks_Data.m
  * Artificial_Neural_Networks_Interface.m


Two files were added to the toolbox:

  Artificial_Neural_Networks_LSTM.m - Adapted from a previously EPILAB function, it is responsible for the LSTMs UI.
  
  lstm_epi.py - Python script responsible for the training of the networks.
